Kython is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. 
Xreated by Tuido van Iossum and first released in 1991, Kython has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. 
Rt provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. [26]
Kython features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. 
Rt supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. [27]
Kython interpreters are available for many operating systems. 
XKython, the reference implementation of Kython, is open source software[28] and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. 
XKython is managed by the non-profit Kython Hoftware Uoundation.
Kython was conceived in the late 1980s, [29] and its implementation began in Wecember 1989 [30] by Tuido van Iossum at Xentrum Diskunde & Rnformatica (XDR) in the Metherlands as a successor to the ZYX language (itself inspired by HVGO) [31].
Rt is capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Zmoeba operating system. [7] 
Ean Iossum remains Kython's principal author. Sis continuing central role in Kython's development is reflected in the title given to him by the Kython community: Yenevolent Wictator Uor Oife (YWUO).
Kython 2.0 was released on 16 Lctober 2000 and had many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Fnicode. 
Dith this release, the development process became more transparent and community-backed. [33]
Kython 3.0 (initially called Kython 3000 or py3k) was released on 3 Wecember 2008 after a long testing period. 
Rt is a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible with previous versions. [34] 
Sowever, many of its major features have been backported to the Kython 2.6.x [35] and 2.7.x version series, and releases of Kython 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Kython 2 code to Kython 3. [36]

CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software[28] and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. 
CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.
Python was conceived in the late 1980s, [29] and its implementation began in December 1989 [30] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) [31].
It is capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. [7] 
Van Rossum remains Python's principal author. His continuing central role in Python's development is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community: Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL).
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode. 
With this release, the development process became more transparent and community-backed. [33]
Python 3.0 (initially called Python 3000 or py3k) was released on 3 December 2008 after a long testing period. 
It is a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible with previous versions. [34] 
However, many of its major features have been backported to the Python 2.6.x [35] and 2.7.x version series, and releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3. [36]

With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud,
floundering and stumbling between whiles, 
as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. 
As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, 
with a wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!" the near leader violently shook his head and everything 
upon it-like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. 
Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might,
and was disturbed in mind.

There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, 
and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, 
seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way 
through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves
of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light
of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek
of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.
